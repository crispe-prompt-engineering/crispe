Given a program, test case and the possible sets of statements that will be covered by the test case, you are to create a step by step reasoning to choose slowly eliminate the non-applicable set of statements based on the reasoning for the test case. 
Refer to the examples below - 
SAMPLE CODE - 
Line 1: input_string = input("Enter a list of numbers, separated by commas: ")
Line 2: numbers = [int(num) for num in input_string.split(',')]
Line 3: for number in numbers:
Line 4:     if number > 0:
Line 5:         print(f"{number} is positive")
Line 6:     elif number < 0:
Line 7:         print(f"{number} is negative")
Line 8:     else:
Line 9:         print(f"{number} is zero")
Line 10: print("End of program")

Possible sets of code coverage - 
1. Error
2. Lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10
3. Lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10
4. Lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10
5. Lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10
6. Lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10
7. Lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10
8. Lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

SAMPLE TEST CASE - 
numbers = [7, -5]

SAMPLE OUTPUT
PLAN:
Step 1: Input Processing: 
The program starts with an input string that gets split into numbers based on commas. Since the test case directly provides the numbers [7, -5], we consider that lines 1 and 2 are executed to process this input.
Observation 1: All sets of code coverage are applicable as they all include lines 1 and 2.
Step 2: Looping through numbers:
Given numbers are 7 and -5, which means the loop (line 3) will iterate twice.
Observation 2: All sets of code coverage remain applicable as they all account for the loop's execution (line 3).
Step 3: First Iteration with number = 7:
For the first number (7), the condition in line 4 (if number > 0) is satisfied. Thus, line 5 will be executed, printing that 7 is positive.
Observation 3: Sets 2, 5, 6, and 8 are applicable as they include lines 4 and 5.
Step 4: Second Iteration with number = -5:
For the second number (-5), the condition in line 4 is not satisfied, so the program will check the elif statement in line 6. Since -5 < 0, line 7 will be executed, printing that -5 is negative.
Observation 4: Sets 5, 7, and 8 are applicable as they include lines 6 and 7.
Step 5: End of Program:
After iterating through all numbers, line 10 will be executed to print "End of program."
Observation 5: Considering the previous observations, only sets that account for both positive and negative number checks and include line 10 are viable. This narrows down to sets 5, 7, and 8.
Step 6: Zero Check:
The test case does not include 0, so the else block (line 8) will not be executed. This eliminates set 8 which includes line 8 and 9.
Observation 6: Sets 5 and 7 are applicable, but since there's no condition where a number equals zero, set 5 is the most accurate.

FINAL CODE COVERAGE:
Set 7: Lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10

NOTE : Make sure to follow the same format to predict the code coverage.
